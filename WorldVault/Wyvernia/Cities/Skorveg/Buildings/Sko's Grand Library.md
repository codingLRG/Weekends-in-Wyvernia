> Outside: An ivory stone building with a Bell Tower Clock for a roof. This cold structure greets you with black text carved off the face of the building "Sko's Grand Library" with the subtext written underneath: "Through knowledge you find freedom"

> Inside: The sound of the swinging pendulum's creek occasionally echo through the room. The bookshelves look of old, darken oak, with proud creatures etched into the wood.
> This place looks well maintained, but the building has not seen serious renovations in quite some time. The old Halfling woman behind the counter heads no mind to you as she writes with her pen and quill.
