> Outside: A finely built cobblestone tavern with fine wooden overhangs and a sign with a topless mermaid with the text leaving her mouth: Singing Siren

> Inside: A fairly welcoming room with few but hearty banter. The tables are repurposed broken ship wheel and stools carved with seashells designs.
> The tavern does not scream danger, as there are two guards calming enjoying their brew, and the barkeep seems welcoming and eager to talk to paying customer
