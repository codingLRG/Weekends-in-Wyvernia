## Background
[[Isaac|Steeve]] didn't get to indulge in many personal interest growing up since he was trained as a soldier from an early age. Since his retirement, [[Isaac|Steeve]]'s began studying about [[Giant|Giants]] given their similarity to [[Dwarf|Dwarves]] (swing big thing for big damage) and believes he can improve on their fighting tactics even with his smaller size. Head trauma from previous battles has worsened his thinking ability, but occasionally he'll form a decent idea; ie. he a little dumb, but he got the spirit.
## Goals
Earn a fortune and purchase a mountain (payment is optional), then start a mining company in said mountain to earn even more money. Don't ask him what all that money's for, otherwise he'll get stuck thinking about it until he's hungry.
## Beliefs
As a war veteran, he's a bit racist, chaotic, and isn't the smartest little [[Giant]]. He thinks a good offense is the best defense.
