## Background
[[Alice|Sylvy]] was born into a noble house of [[Tiefling]], known as the [[Valiss]]. Their great house has a lineage of great and powerful “sorcerers” with a “divine bloodline”. Their real strength truly comes from their family line pact with [[The Ancient One]] in the deepest depths of the seas. Every [[Valiss]] born into the lineage is born into a pact with the ancient being “blessed” with powers and riches. So long as you continue its bidding. [[Alice|Sylvy]] having no interest in upholding her family’s dark secrets and lineage, ran away to try and make it out on her own, but running from the family home, didn't mean she was free from her pact.

## Goals
[[Alice|Sylvy]] hopes to find on her travels, a way to free herself and her sisters back home from this ancient pact of servitude and to hopefully break ties with the being holding power of her family.
## Beliefs
Whilst being knowledgeable in religion, finds no solace in faith. Her view forever jaded from her upbringing. A free spirit who wishes to free herself and others from any and all forms of forced servitude.
