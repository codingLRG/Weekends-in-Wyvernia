## Background
[[Angel|Mirnes]] was born into a warrior clan, but was a terrible fighter. With no competent combat prowess she was ostracized. Then the [[Mirnes's Mentor|clan's shaman]] took her in as an apprentice feeling her talents lies elsewhere. Throughout her time there she would write down all of her mentor's knowledge and teachings in a [[Mirnes's Journal|book]]. Even with the teaching could only cast the beginner spells. So her mentor told her to leave the clan and explore the world to master his teachings. Later that night she while she was asleep something happened but she has no clue what as when she woke up she was in [[Lost|unknown territory]]. So her journey starts.  
## Goal
is to secure enough [[Fortune|money]] to live. Overall goal to find any and all clue leading to her [[Clan|clan's]] fate and most importantly her [[Shaman Mentor|mentor]]. Survival first, clues later. 
## Beliefs
The only faith she has is what written in her [[Mirnes's Journal|book]]. Hates incompetents from those with more talent than her as she feels they squandered it. Speaks her mind even if it is not what people want to hear. Will try her best to keep those around her alive.
