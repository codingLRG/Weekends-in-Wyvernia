## Race
[[Human]]
## Background
Casper was a right-hand man to an [[Infamous Pirate]]. After a terrible call by his captain who had grown to be more greedy and careless and attacking an island with [[Fey]] magic surrounding it, he had woken up back on mainland alone. He had tried getting on a ship but was struck with [[Sea Sickness]] he had never once experienced and was forced to leave the pirate life for good. 
## Goal
His main goal is to find that island, which may cure him of his [[Sea Sickness]].
## Belief
Even though he was with a pretty infamous captain and a pirate, he was mainly in it for the excitement and was overall a fair person. He'd make sure to feed the prisoners and hated getting innocents blood in his hand since he believes in an [[Afterlife]].
